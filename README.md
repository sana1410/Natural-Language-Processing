<h1>Natural Language Processing with Disaster Tweets</h1>
<hr><p>In this competition, you’re challenged to build a machine learning model that predicts which Tweets are about real disasters and which one’s aren’t. You’ll have access to a dataset of 10,000 tweets that were hand classified</p><h2>General Information</h2>
<hr><ul>
<li>The project is taken from https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/nlp-getting-started</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>Build a machine learning model that predicts which Tweets are about real disasters and which one’s aren’t.</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>The ubiquitousness of smartphones enables people to announce an emergency they’re observing in real-time. Because of this, more agencies are interested in programatically monitoring Twitter (i.e. disaster relief organizations and news agencies).</li>

<h1>Music is all you need!</h1>
<hr><p>The project is to build a machine-learning model that can accurately predict the genre of a song based on its attributes</p><h2>General Information</h2>
<hr><ul>
<li>This Datathon is organized by The Data Science Hub at Northeastern University</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>Explore and analyze the dataset to identify patterns and insights related to music genres and audio features.</li>
<li>Investigate the role of song lyrics in genre classification. Develop methods to extract meaningful information from lyrics and incorporate it into the classification model.</li>
<li>Develop a robust multi-class classification model for genre prediction.</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>To discover intriguing insights about how different audio characteristics correlate with genre preferences, giving you a deeper understanding of the magic of music. This project could revolutionize how people discover and enjoy music, and it all starts with making the right song-genre connections</li>
