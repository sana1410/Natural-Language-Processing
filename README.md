<h1>Natural Language Processing with Disaster Tweets</h1>
<hr><p>In this competition, you’re challenged to build a machine learning model that predicts which Tweets are about real disasters and which one’s aren’t. You’ll have access to a dataset of 10,000 tweets that were hand classified</p><h2>General Information</h2>
